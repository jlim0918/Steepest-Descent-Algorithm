# Steepest-Descent-Algorithm
Polynomial Local Minimizer using Steepest Descent Algorithm

Locates the local minimum of polynomials using a directional search algorithm called Steepest Descent.
From a selected feasible point, a direction and distance along that direction would identified.
A step would be taken to land on a feasible point closer towards the local minimum.
This process would be repeated until a stopping criteria (maximum # of iterations reached or sufficiently close to true minimum) was achieved.

Version 1: Polynomial Functions must be manually typed and entered
Version 2: Multiple Polynomial Functions can be loaded from a separete .csv file
Version 3: Step size in previous versions was fixed. Armijo Line Search and Golden Section Search (GSS) methods were used in this version to identify step size.
